## Spirii code challenge

## How to run
$ go run ./cmd/main.go


## How to test 
$ go test ./... -count 1 -short


## Notes
Done in less than 1 hour since I don't principally allow myself to allocate more time for unpaid coding tests.
No AI used - not that I won't use it in my day-to-day, but for the purpose of showing my thinking.
